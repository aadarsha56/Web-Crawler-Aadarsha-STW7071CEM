Additionally, both disordered sleep and these psychiatric disorders appear to be independently associated with altered autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. We hypothesise that ANS dysregulation during sleep may explain part of the relationship between poor sleep and mood- and anxiety-related disorders. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a frequently used marker of ANS function and gives an indication of ANS input to the heart - in particular, of the relative contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. A systematic review of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science yielded 41 studies dealing with sleep, mood- and anxiety-related disorders and sleep-related HRV. Hyperarousal during sleep, reflecting a predominance of sympathetic activation and indicative of ANS dysregulation, may be an important factor in the association between poor sleep and mood-related disorders. Longitudinal studies and mediation analyses are necessary to further understand the potential mediating role of ANS dysregulation on the relationship between poor sleep and mood- and anxiety-related disorders.'}"

       " 'abstract': \"Purpose: This research addresses the relationships between the current, dynamic organisational cyber risk climate, organisational cybersecurity performance and changes in cybersecurity investments, with an aim to address the hostile epistemic climate for intellectual capital management presented by the dynamics of cybersecurity as a phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: Expanding on the views of digital security and resilience as a knowledge problem, the research looks at cybersecurity as a critical capability within organisations, particularly relevant in critical infrastructure sectors. The problem is studied from the perspective of 400 C-level executives from critical infrastructure sectors across the UK. Data collected at the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a time when critical infrastructure organisations have been under a significant strain due to an increase in cybersecurity incidents, were analysed using partial least square structural equation modelling. Findings: The research found a significant correlation between the board's perception of a change in their cybersecurity risk climate and patterns of both the development of cybersecurity management capabilities and cybersecurity investments. The authors also found that a positive correlation exists between the efforts placed by critical infrastructure organisations in cybersecurity training and the changes in investment in their cybersecurity, particularly in relation to their intellectual capital development efforts. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper that explores the board's perception of cybersecurity in critical infrastructure organisations both from the intellectual capital perspective and in the dynamic cyber risk climate derived from the COVID-19 crisis. The authors’ findings expand on the growing perception of cybersecurity as a knowledge problem, and thus inform future research and practice in the domain of intellectual capital management and its role in supporting the cybersecurity and digital resilience of business and society.\"}"
